# chendo - endo chat

[Endo][endo] is a distributed secure JavaScript sandbox, based on SES.
CapTP, in one form, is a key part of extending object
references across peers. Spritely Goblins is a scheme implementation
of another form of CapTP.

Goblins chat is a demo distributed chat application.
chendo is intended as [an interop demo][6] between endo and Goblins
via a CapTP bridge.
